# AssistantsAPI_OpenAI
This project is focusing on building AI-driven assistants that can utilize models and tools to perform file searches and business analysis tailored to companyâ€™s needs.

I explored various features of the OpenAI API, including creating and managing threads, as well as handling tool resources. To ensure the API can effectively understand and analyze files, I experimented with different formats, such as .txt and .pdf, and developed a function for uploading files to the vector store, thereby facilitating data integration and processing.

I also created functions to retrieve existing assistants and vector stores, as well as to create new ones when they do not exist. In this process, I engaged in parameter tuning to adjust the temperature and top_p parameters for optimizing response generation. Also, I designed functions to enable users to ask questions to an existing assistant by name or ID, based on the relevant vector store.

With the customized functions, I can efficiently upload the data, enabling a tailored AI assistant that can integrate and process a wide range of data types. For example, I have successfully uploaded earning call transcripts and leveraged the data to identify companies by analyzing their future plans, growth forecast to drive better strategic decisions.
